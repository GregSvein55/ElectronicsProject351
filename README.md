# ElectronicsProject351
This was my final project for my digital electronics course. I created an motion detection alarm system using an STM32F103RB Board. This project also used a PIR motion sensor and a Piezo buzzer as components.<b>
My project report contains all the details about the system and my project schematic shows how it was constructed.
